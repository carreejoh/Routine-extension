# Routine-extension
This extension is a simple chrome app designed to work with the [Routine-Scheduler](https://routine-scheduler.vercel.app/) app. This extension makes it possible to view what's currently happening based on your calender, and sends a chrome notification every 30 minutes if something planned is about to start. Each user of Routine-Scheduler gets a unique "link" upon creation, and this link makes it possible for the extension and database to work together.

## Purpose
I felt that a routine app by itself wasn't too useful. Having the app open constantly is frusterating, so this takes out all of the hassle. Upon opening the extension you instantly know what you should be currently doing, and if you decide to skip the extension, a notification will remind you.

## How to use
Download the extension from Chrome extensions, copy and paste the unique link from your Routine App Dashboard, and submit. 

## Status
Google chrome is currently reviewing my extension for approval. This process shouldn't take more than a month, and should be ready to use very soon.
